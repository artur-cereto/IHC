Prerequisites:

- Python (3.12.4) with Anaconda distribution installed on the machine.
- TauDEM (5.37 - complete Windows Installer) installed on the machine (https://hydrology.usu.edu/taudem/taudem5/downloads.html).

Setting Up the Environment:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Downloading Anaconda:

Download the version for your operating system (https://www.anaconda.com/download/success) and install it.

Replicating the Environment Used to Run IHC:

- Anaconda Distribution:



Select the path of the .yml file, pressing Shift + Right-click on its icon, then click "Copy as path." After that, paste it in place of "path_to_ihc_env_file.yml" in the following step.

Open the Anaconda Command Prompt and run the following command:

    conda env create -f path_to_ihc_env_file.yml


This action will create an environment named ihc_env with the Python version used during the script development and download all necessary libraries in the correct versions to run the script.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running the Application:

In an Anaconda Command Prompt:

1. Activate the environment with the command:
   
       conda activate ihc_env

2. Copy the path of the "Inter_IHC.py" script.

3. Type the following command, replacing the text in quotes with the actual file path, and press Enter:

       python "path_to_Inter_IHC.py"
